This week is "Healthy Habits" week at my school. Seems like a good thing right? Well, yes and no. We are encouraged to exercise this week and eat healthy foods, however, we are also encouraged to make new friends and talk to people we don't know in our grade. The way they encourage us to make new friends is a bit, well, stupid. They give us ribbons to wear on our wrists, then, we have to go sit with anyone wearing the same color ribbons. This means that we have to sit with people we don't know at all, and we have to talk to them for all of lunch. That's like deporting a guy to a random country and saying that it will help him "meet new people". If you don't know anyone you are talking to, if you don't know anything about them, how are you supposed to become friends? How are you supposed to find any similar interests?
