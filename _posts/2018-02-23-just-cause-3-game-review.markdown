This game had many issues at launch because of optimization issues, but in the latest version, its amazing! The story is a bit bland, but its gameplay is exquisite! In the game, you play as a person named Rico Rodriguez. You go around your birth country of Medici, taking back towns and military bases from an evil dictator named Di Ravello. You take back the towns by blowing up propaganda spewing speaker systems around the town, and by driving out Di Ravello's forces! The graphics are amazing, and you can use a grappling hook to tear objects apart! The physics engine is also amazing! Overall, I rate this game a 8/10. The gameplay is solid, however, the story is bland.
