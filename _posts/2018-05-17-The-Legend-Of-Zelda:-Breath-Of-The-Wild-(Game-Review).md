BOTW is a great game. Im gonna say that right off the bat. The game has a nice opening, and I believe that the Wii U version has great controls. The graphics are top notch, and the voice acting is top notch. The story is also great. The game does have its downsides though. First of all, the switch version has terrible controls. The game also is very slow. It can take literally hours just to walk somewhere! They did make some DLC that gives you a motorcycle, however you have to complete the game on the hardest difficulty just to get it! If you can look past that, you can see all of its upsides though. The game is a 8/10. Its very slow, but its great when the action really picks up.
