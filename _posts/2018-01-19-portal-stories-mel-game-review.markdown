Portal Stories: Mel is an amazingly crafted game. From the amazing logic puzzles, to the exquisite soundtrack, its great all around! It is a free indie mod, based on the game Portal:2. It is a prequel to the game Portal:2, and it adds a lot of story to the Portal game series. The voice acting is amazing, the puzzles are challenging, and the graphics are exquisite. I dont know how they did it, but the team behind Portal Stories: Mel, is amazing. The soundtrack is also really good. [(Heres a song from the game)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vDHuSdOFOg) Harry Callaghan and Ian Wiese really outdid themselves with the soundtrack! I give this game, an 11/10
