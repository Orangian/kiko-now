Hello, if anyone was ever even reading my blog, I am going to start posting on it now! I did not know what to post before, but now, I know what to post. I am starting up a youtube channel with me, my brother, and my buddy Charles. More people might come onto the channel later, however, we are just starting up now. I have begun to work on a banner for the channel, and an intro for the videos. I will do most of the editing for the videos, and I will inform everyone of the channel progress using this blog. I will try to start up the channel today, however as my friend Charles is having computer problems, it may have to be delayed.
