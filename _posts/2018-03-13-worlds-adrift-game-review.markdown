World's Adrift is a fantastic game created by the renowned Bossa Studios. Before making this game, Bossa only made games where you played as a piece of bread, however, they have somehow managed to make a HUUGE MMO, despite having no experience dealing with games of this caliber. This game, despite being in Pre-Alpha, is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. The physics ARE AMAZING. The grappling hook rope even has PHYSICS. ON A ROPE. DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD THAT IS? THE GAME IS GLITCHY YES, BUT ITS IN PRE ALPHA. THE ONLY EXPERIENCE BOSSA HAD WAS MAKING A GAME WHERE YOU PLAY AS TOAST. A PIECE OF TOAST. THEY BARELY MAKE ANY PROFIT EVERY YEAR. HOW DID THEY MAKE THIS A HUUUUUUGE MMO? HOW DID THEY MAKE THIS SO GOOD? I DONT KNOW. I RATE THIS A 20/10. HOW IS THIS SO GOOD? On a serious note, the game IS a sandbox game, so you may not like that. In the game, you upgrade your ship and fly around. I personally like that, but some people might find it bland and boring. 11/10 game. Vidyah Game Dunko should review this.
