The Samsung Galaxy S8+ is an exquisitely crafted device. Its screen takes up nearly the entire front of the device, and the screen is so high quality! The colors are accurate, it has a 1440P screen, and its such a big screen! The camera has a resolution of 8MP! The camera even has OIS, meaning that the camera has tiny motors that move it to stabilize images! The phone is blazing fast with its Octa-Core processor, and 4 GB of ram! Overall, I rate this phone a 10/10. I have owned this phone for 10 months, so I have used it a lot.
