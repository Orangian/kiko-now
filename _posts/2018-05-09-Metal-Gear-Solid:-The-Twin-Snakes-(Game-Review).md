MGS:TTS is the HD remake of Metal Gear Solid. Released in 2004, this game introduced many new mechanics to MGS. First person aiming from MGS:2 was added in, and the models and textures were highly improved. Since this is a full remake, the game came out on the Gamecube. Many voices were re-recorded for the game, and the audio quality is much higher. This game is amazing. There are a few issues though. The game is very buggy, the cutscenes were turned into generic action sequences, and the game crashes often. The bugs and crashes are a problem of copying the disc into an ISO file though, so they arent present in the actual game. The audio and visuals are superb, and the mechanics are great.  I rate this game a 6.5/10. There are many bugs present in the actual game, and the cutscenes have been reduced to generic action garbage.
