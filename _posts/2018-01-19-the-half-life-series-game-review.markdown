Recently, I replayed the Half-Life series. I played Black Mesa, Half-Life:2 Half-Life:2: EP1 and Half-Life:2: EP2. I personally **love** the game series. Half-Life:1 was revolutionary. It made games actually have a story. Half-Life:2 made physics and advanced facial animation a standard in video games, and the story is **amazing**. The games are challenging, and while the graphics are a bit dated, they were amazing for their time. Half-Life:2 was years ahead of other games in terms of graphics, and physics. I would give the entire series a 10/10.
