So, I am reading a book called Three Times lucky in my ELA class, and this book is just plain weird. In this book, the main characters are mainly eleven, however, they all work in shops and such. There are no schools in their town and the main two characters which are only eleven both drive in a NASCAR race. Another character, named Dale at one point in the story, points at a picture of a woman on a shop wall, and says "THOSE ARE FAKE BOOBS!!! THE HAIR IS FAKE TOO!". I am not joking, that is in the first 52 pages of the book. I am extremely confused by this book because of all of this.
