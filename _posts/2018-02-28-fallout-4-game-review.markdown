Fallout 4 is a mediocre game. I know some people praise it like they praise their god, but to be honest, it's not that good. The story is not that good. A lot of the content in the game goes unnoticed because you have to search for hours to find some things (Like the atom cats) and good plot elements are few and far between. Playing this game vanilla is a chore. You need at least 10 mods to make the game look like it was made after 1990, and you need mods to make the game actually playable. Seriously though, the game looks like it was made on the gold-source engine. Overall, I give this game a 2/10
