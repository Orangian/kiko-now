Codenames-Pictures is an exquisitely constructed game. I recently played it, and it is amazing. The pressure from your teammates slowly crushes you as the round goes on. The game is in a simple cardboard box, the instructions are easy to follow, and it doesn't take a lot of time to set up. The game  REALLY needs you to think. The objective is for your team to get all of your cards. How this is done is, you have one person (The "Spymaster") from each team (There are two teams) that looks at the cards.  There is a master card that indicates which cards help which team. The "Spymaster" from your team tries to come up with a word that describes a card that supports your team, and then you have to guess which card they were describing. The game doesn't sound fun in a review, but trust me, it really is! It's amazing! You really need to strategise in this game, and you have to work together with your team to win. I would definitely recommend this game for ages 11 and up. I think its too hard for young children. The game came out in 2016, and each round lasts about twenty minutes. I would rate it a five out of five.
