Everyone knows that states have their own individual laws, but do you really know why they have their own laws on everything, and why some people are against states making their own laws on certain topics? I personally support states making their own laws, even for things like net neutrality. People can get into positions of power in the government way too easily, so states should be able to make laws fixing the government's mistakes.


 Take net neutrality laws for example. Ajit Pai (A man which has been placed in the government by ISP's) has changed Net Neutrality's "Legal Footing". Essentially, he is allowing companies to make an "Internet package" making you pay for access to websites like google. A lot of people do not like this at all. So, some states (Like Georgia) made their own laws, keeping the internet free in their state. This shows, that if states make their own laws, in most cases, those laws will be beneficial to their state, making everyone (Except Ajit Pai) happy. 


"So, if individual states having their own laws makes the general population happy, why do some people hate state laws?" Well, this is mainly due to debates over state  environmental laws. If one state is fine with waste being dumped in a river that runs into another state, and the other state doesnt like the pollution, then just stop them from making their own laws about the environment, right?


 Well, that creates more problems than it solves. Some states may not like companies drilling deep into the surface of the earth to get natural gases because it will cause an earthquake, while other states, may need natural gas drilling, to sustain their economy. This is like banning all chat programs on a computer because one person said something you didn't like. States need to have their own laws and views on environmental issues, because each state is different, environmentally speaking.


 The solution here, would just to be to view every conflict between neighboring states laws, on their own. If you see a conflict between two lines of code in a program, you don't delete everything relating to it, you resolve the conflict.  States should be able to make their own laws because every state is different. You couldn't look at one person and think "every human is like that" because no one is exactly alike. "What if state laws conflict with laws made by the central government?" This goes back to resolving every conflict, case by case. If a state law clashes with a law made by Congress, resolve that specific conflict, in its own particular way. Deal with the conflict in the best way for that particular conflict. If the people who made both of the conflicting laws have any time, contact them, and try to get them to make a compromise. If none of them can resolve the conflict after arguing for a long time, you may ultimately have to use the supreme court.
