The Games Portal and Portal:2 are amazing games. From their creative use of "Gels" and the exquisitely crafted portal gun makes the game series one of the best I have ever played. This puzzle game series requires you to use logic and physics to complete the puzzles, and, in portal 2, it even lets you make your own puzzles! The game series is a 10/10. The games are really cheap on steam, so I recommend you buy them!
