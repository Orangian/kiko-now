So, we watched this video about the fictional story "Goldilocks" and we have to write about what crimes Goldilocks committed. I think she committed these crimes, Breaking and entering, criminal trespassing,  vandalism, destruction of private property,disorderly conduct ,theft,disturbing the peace, and causing a panic. She caused a panic by scaring the family, she committed vandalism and destroyed private property by breaking the chair, she broke and entered and trespassed by being in their house, and she stole the porridge. She also committed disorderly conduct because she broke into a house and slept in it even though it wasnt her house. She also disturbed the peace by sleeping in someones house, eating their soup, and scaring them by appearing in their house. She also ran out once she was spotted leading the bears to believe it was a robbery. Her parents also endangered a child by allowing here to roam freely in a forest with BEARS living in it.
