For one of my classes, we had to write a story (And act it out) and write it in a way where you could make tons of inferences from it. Three other people in my group however, just decided to do a horrible stranger things recreation. Every time me and another group member try to suggest an idea, we are just told to shut up. We shut up, and then they start saying that we are not contributing anything and that we are not helping the group. I am VERY frustrated by this. Comment below if you have had any experiences like this.
