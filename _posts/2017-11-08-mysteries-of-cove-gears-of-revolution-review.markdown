Hello! This is a very short book review on MOC:Gears of Revolution. The Plot: The plot for Gears Of Revolution is good for people around the age of 12 and up. It is the successor to Fires Of Invention and follows a boy named Trenton and a girl named Kallista. I personally enjoy the plot. Characters: Generic Whipjacks, Trenton, Kallista, Agnus, Simoni, and much more.

Final verdict: I enjoy this book a lot and would recommend it to anyone else.
