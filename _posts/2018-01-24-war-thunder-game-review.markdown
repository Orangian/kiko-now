War Thunder is a free online multiplayer game that allows you to drive tanks or fly planes, in a WW2 setting. The game allows you to "research" new vehicles, allowing you to decide if you want to fly, a bomber for example, or a high-speed fighter jet. The game has an amazing physics engine, rivaled only by its graphical fidelity. The game is meticulously crafted, with every part of your vehicle being damaged. Someone could only shoot out the barrel of your turret, or take out your vehicle's axels. Even different bullet types have a different effect. The crew in your vehicle is also able to be injured. If your gunner gets dazed, they will have less accuracy. This game looks nice, plays nice, and has basically zero bugs, aside from the occasional tank spaz. I give this game, an 11/10.
